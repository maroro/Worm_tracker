    %circshift Function: This MATLAB function circularly shifts the
    % elements of an array. Basically moves along the the boundary by a
    % determined amount. In this case it is called ksep: the total length
    % of the boundary divided by 20

    % Bd_plus and Bd_minus Calculation: By shifting CurrentBoundary by 
    % ksep positions forward and backward, respectively, you create two 
    % new arrays. These arrays represent points on the boundary that
    % are ksep positions ahead of and behind each original point,
    % considering the boundary as a continuous loop.
    Bd_size = size(MainBoundary,1);
    ksep = ceil(Bd_size/20); 
    Bd_plus = circshift(MainBoundary,[ksep 0]);
    Bd_minus = circshift(MainBoundary,[-ksep 0]);
    
    % Vectors AA and BB: The difference between CurrentBoundary and its
    % shifted versions (Bd_plus and Bd_minus) calculates vectors 
    % pointing from one boundary point to another, ksep steps away. 
    % These vectors span segments of the boundary curve.
    AA = MainBoundary - Bd_plus; 
    BB = MainBoundary - Bd_minus;

    %Complex Representation: By combining the x and y components of
    % these vectors into complex numbers (cAA and cBB), the code 
    % prepares to analyze the boundary in terms of angles. This 
    % representation facilitates the use of complex arithmetic to 
    % explore the geometry of the boundary.
    cAA = AA(:,1) + 1i*AA(:,2); 
    cBB = BB(:,1) + 1i*BB(:,2);

    % between each pair of vectors (AA and BB) around each boundary 
    % point. Because these vectors are represented as complex numbers,
    % dividing cBB by cAA gives a complex number whose argument (angle
    % in the complex plane) represents the angle between the two vectors

    %unwrap Function: The unwrap function is applied to the array of
    % angles to adjust the values to prevent discontinuities greater 
    % than Ï€ radians. This is important for correctly interpreting 
    % the angles along the boundary, especially over a continuous 
    % sequence where the angle might logically transition through a
    % point that would naively appear as a discontinuous jump.
    Bd_angle = unwrap(angle(cBB ./ cAA));% This operation computes the angle (in radians)
    
    %min_angle_pt_index1: This finds the index of the boundary point 
    % where the angle between vectors AA and BB is minimal. This angle
    % represents the point of highest curvature, which could correspond
    % to either the head or tailthe worm.
    min_angle_pt_index1 = find(Bd_angle == min(Bd_angle),1);
    
% Circshift and Second Minimum: The boundary angles array
% (Bd_angle) is circularly shifted so that the point with the
% minimum angle found above is moved to the start of the array.
% This manipulation facilitates finding another significant point 
% on the boundary:
    
    %Bd_angle1: A version of Bd_angle shifted based on the first
    % minimum angle 
    Bd_angle_first = circshift(Bd_angle, - min_angle_pt_index1);
    
    %min_angle_pt_index2bis: Finds a second point of interest by 
    % searching for the minimum angle in a subset of Bd_angle1. This
    % subset excludes the quarter of points nearest to the first
    % minimum point to ensure the second point is on the opposite side 
    % of the object. 
    min_angle_pt_index2bis = round(.25*Bd_size) - 1 + ...
    find(Bd_angle_first(round(.25*Bd_size):round(.75*Bd_size))== ...
    min(Bd_angle_first(round(.25*Bd_size):round(.75*Bd_size))),1);
    
    % min_angle_pt_index2: Adjusts the index of the second point found
    % to account for the circular shift and aligns it with the original
    % boundary indexing
    min_angle_pt_index2 = 1+mod(min_angle_pt_index2bis + ...
                                min_angle_pt_index1 - 1, Bd_size);
    
    % Bd_shifted: The boundary array is shifted so the first minimum 
    % angle point is at the start. This reordering simplifies the 
    % extraction of paths from the head to tail (or vice versa).
    Bd_shifted = circshift(MainBoundary, [1-min_angle_pt_index1 0]);

    %end1: Calculates the end index for one of the paths based on the 
    % distance between the two points of interest.
    end1 = 1+mod(min_angle_pt_index2 - min_angle_pt_index1 - 1, Bd_size);
    % path1 and path2: Two paths are defined from the point with the 
    % minimum angle (possibly the head or tail). path1 goes from this 
    % point to the second point of interest, and path2 takes the 
    % reverse route. These paths could represent the organism's body
    % from head to tail and tail to head, respectively.
